										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Lake-2-1200x675.jpg" alt="Electrofishing Boat" /></span>Common Carp (<i>Cyprinus carpio</i>) are one of the most widely introduced and ecologically 
											disruptive aquatic species in the world. During foraging, Common Carp uproot submerged aquatic vegetation, alter nutrient dynamics, and re-suspend sediment 
											into the water column, which can drastically reduce water quality and clarity and restructure entire aquatic ecosystems. Carp removal has been shown to reverse 
											state shifts, but the growing consensus is that an adaptive, multifaceted approach that increases ecological resilience in addition to reducing stressors 
											is needed for successful restoration. Transplanting submerged aquatic vegetation following carp removal offers one strategy that can help reestablish nativereestablish native species in 
											systems where seed banks have been depleted. The aim of this project is to inform Common Carp removal and vegetation restoration efforts in Lake Mattamuskeet, a large (16,314-ha) and 
											shallow (~1-m), hypereutrophic lake located in the Mattamuskeet National Wildlife Refuge in eastern North Carolina. </p>

												<h4>Population characteristics and Removal Feasibility of Common Carp</h4>
												<p>This first component of this study informs Common Carp removal in Lake Mattamuskeet by characterizing critical baseline population characteristics, estimating biomass, 
													and simulating population-level responses to harvest using age-structured models.</p>

												<h4>Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) restoration</h4>
												<p>The second component of this study informs submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) restoration efforts in Lake Mattamuskeet by evaluating the establishment, overwinter survival, 
													and growth potential of three native, macrophyte species [<i>Vallisneria americana </i> (submerged), <i>Najas guadalupensis</i> (submerged), <i>Nymphaea odorata</i> (floating-leaf)] when planted alone 
													and together, and measure localized water quality parameters that may impact transplantation success.</p>

												<h4>Lake Mattamuskeet Watershed Restoration Plan</h4>
												<p> Lake Mattamuskeet is North Carolina's Largest natural lake and an important natural and cultural landmark for Eastern North Carolina. Recently, the lake experienced a total loss of submerged aquatic 
													vegetation and was listed on the State 303(d) List for Impaired Waters for high nutrient levels and harmful algae blooms. To address these issues, Hyde County, the N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission, the 
													U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the North Carolina Coastal Federation developed a watershed restoration plan that addresses issues of concern, including poor water quality 
													within the Lake as well as chronic and persistent flooding on the surrounding landscape. Through my thesis research and collaboration with local, state, and federal state stakeholders I shared 
													my research findings at Technical Working Group meetings, Public stakeholder Forums, and at the Plan's unveiling in 2019.</p>
