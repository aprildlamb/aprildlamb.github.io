									<h3 id="content">Informing Common Carp Removal and Submerged Aquatic Vegetation Restoration in Lake Mattamuskeet</h3>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Lake-2-1200x675.jpg" alt="Electrofishing Boat" /></span>Common Carp (<i>Cyprinus carpio</i>) are one of the most widely introduced and ecologically 
											disruptive aquatic species in the world. During foraging, Common Carp uproot submerged aquatic vegetation, alter nutrient dynamics, and re-suspend sediment 
											into the water column, which can drastically reduce water quality and clarity and restructure entire aquatic ecosystems. Carp removal has been shown to reverse 
											state shifts, but the growing consensus is that an adaptive, multifaceted approach that increases ecological resilience in addition to reducing stressors 
											is needed for successful restoration. Transplanting submerged aquatic vegetation following carp removal offers one strategy that can help reestablish nativereestablish native species in 
											systems where seed banks have been depleted. The aim of this project is to inform Common Carp removal and vegetation restoration efforts in Lake Mattamuskeet, a large (16,314-ha) and 
											shallow (~1-m), hypereutrophic lake located in the Mattamuskeet National Wildlife Refuge in eastern North Carolina. </p>

												<h4>Population characteristics and Removal Feasibility of Common Carp</h4>
												<p>This first component of this study informs Common Carp removal in Lake Mattamuskeet by characterizing critical baseline population characteristics, estimating biomass, 
													and simulating population-level responses to harvest using age-structured models.</p>

												<h4>Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) restoration</h4>
												<p>The second component of this study informs submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) restoration efforts in Lake Mattamuskeet by evaluating the establishment, overwinter survival, 
													and growth potential of three native, macrophyte species [<i>Vallisneria americana </i> (submerged), <i>Najas guadalupensis</i> (submerged), <i>Nymphaea odorata</i> (floating-leaf)] when planted alone 
													and together, and measure localized water quality parameters that may impact transplantation success.</p>

												<h4>Lake Mattamuskeet Watershed Restoration Plan</h4>
												<p> Lake Mattamuskeet is North Carolina's Largest natural lake and an important natural and cultural landmark for Eastern North Carolina. Recently, the lake experienced a total loss of submerged aquatic 
													vegetation and was listed on the State 303(d) List for Impaired Waters for high nutrient levels and harmful algae blooms. To address these issues, Hyde County, the N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission, the 
													U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the North Carolina Coastal Federation developed a <a href "https://www.nccoast.org/protect-the-coast/stormwater/lake-mattamuskeet-watershed-restoration/"> Watershed Restoration Plan </a>
													that addresses issues of concern including poor water quality, Common Carp biomass, SAV loss, and chronic and persistent flooding on the surrounding landscape. </p>

												<h4>1 million-dollar FY23 Large Invasive Species Grant</h4>
												<p> After defending my thesis, I had the opportunity to collaborate with biologists from the Mattamuskeet National Wildlife Refuge and NC Wildlife Resources Comission on a <a href "https://coastalreview.org/2021/10/carp-removal-next-step-to-healthier-lake-mattamuskeet/"> 
													$1 million dollar federal RFP </a> to remove Common Carp from Lake Mattamuskeet. The grant was awarded in early 2021 and the funds will be available starting FY23.</p>

									<h3 id="content">Geckos on Curaçao</h3>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/croppedgecko.jpg" alt="Hemidactylus mabouia gecko" /></span>While at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, I had the opporutnity 
											to lead several projects aimed at better understanding the natural history of cryptic geckos on the Dutch Caribbean Island of Curaçao. There are three species of gecko native to 
											Curaçao- <i>Thecadactylus rapicauda</i>, <i>Phyllodactylus martini</i>, and <i>Gonatodes antillensis</i>- and one invasive species of concern- <i>Hemidactylus mabouia</i>. 
											<i> Hemidactylus mabouia </i> is one of the most successful, widespread invasive reptile species and has become ubiquitous across tropical urban settings in the Western Hemisphere, 
											including Curaçao. Its ability to thrive in close proximity to humans has been linked to the rapid disappearance of native geckos. On Curaçao, increased urbanization of the island's
											"mondi" habitat rasies the question: are native gecko populations being displaced by <i> Hemidactylus mabouia</i>? The following work aims to address this and related topics. </p>

												<h4>Comparing Ecomorphology and Diet of native <i> Phyllodactylus martini </i> and invasive <i> Hemidactylus mabouia </i> </h4>
												<p> Aspects of Hemidactylus mabouia natural history and ecomorphology, often assumed to be linked with this effect on native populations, 
												remain understudied or untested. Here, we combine data from ∂15N and ∂13C stable isotopes, stomach contents, and morphometric analyses of traits associated with feeding and locomotion to 
												test alternate hypotheses of displacement between H. mabouia and a native gecko, Phyllodactylus martini, on the island of Curaçao.</p>
											</div>
											<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
												<h4>Geckos as Transport Hosts for Caribbean Parasites</h4>
												<p>Many gecko species are human commensals with activity periods that overlap temporally with those of domestic cats, making them prime 
													candidates as potential transport hosts for cat parasites. However, no studies have reported geckos as paratenic hosts for felid 
													parasites on any Caribbean island. Here we report the first records of subcutaneous oligacanthorhynchid cystacanths on the Venezuelan 
													Coastal Clawed Gecko (<i>Gonatodes antillensis</i>) based on specimens collected in Curaçao and Bonaire.</p>
